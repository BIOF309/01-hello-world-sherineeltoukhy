    "> In particular, the more modern systems, such as Git and [Mercurial](http://swcarpentry.github.io/hg-novice/)\n",
    "> are *distributed*, meaning that they do not need a centralized server to host the repository.\n",
    "> These modern systems also include powerful merging tools that make it possible for multiple authors to work within\n",
    "> the same files concurrently.\n",
