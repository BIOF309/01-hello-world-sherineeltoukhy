Course Description
------------------

This course is designed for non-programmers,
biologists, or
those without specific knowledge of python to learn how to
program.
Week by week
we will slowly build up your skills and understanding of
programming and the
python language. As with learning
any language you will get
as much out of this
class as you put in more effort. There will be in class
demonstrations and
Homework most weeks for you to practice and learn at your own
pace.


Learning
Objectives
-------------------

By the end of this course you
should be able to:
1. Look at a task and determine if you can or should automate it
2. Create
working python programs
3. Understand the difference between different object
types in python (i.e. lists, dicts)
4. Do basic data analysis with python
Logistics
---------

This is a one-semester course starting on the 11th
of
September 2017 and finishing on 18th of December 2017.

* Meeting Time and
Place: 5:30 Section - Rathskeller, Building 60, NIH Bethesda campus
* Meeting
Time and Place: 7:30 Section - Rathskeller, Building 60, NIH Bethesda campus
Attendance in class is strongly recommended; however, we realize other
commitments will occasionally prevent attendance. 
If you miss a class, please
review the materials available at the course [github
repository](https://github.com/marskar/BIO309_Fall2017).

You may only attend
the section for which you signed up. Do **NOT** attend other sections **UNLESS**
given premission to do so by the instructor.

Most classes will have hands-on
tutorials and assignments. Both practice and graded assignments will generally
be
provided. Graded assignments should be submitted prior to the following
class.
So that you can follow along during class, bringing a laptop to each
class
is
strongly encouraged.

Important dates:
* September 11 : Class starts
*
September 11 - September 29 : Late Registration ($10.00 late registration fee
per course applies)
* October 6 : Last day to drop/withdraw
* November 10 : Last
day to change status (credit or audit)
* December 18 : Class ends

Required
Materials
------------------

**Each student is encouraged to bring their own
laptop to each class.** 
*Programing without a computer would be an exceptional
feat.*

For the course, we will use Python 3. Any python installation should
work, but you
must be able to install packages. The [Anaconda Scientific Python
Distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) from Continuum Analytics will
likely be the easiest approach to configuring python if you do not already have
python installed. The Anaconda installer will automatically install many of the
packages we will use during the course. Or see the guidelines on
http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/ that were emailed to you.

Optional
Materials
------------------

GitHub is offering some awesome resources, that
might be interesting you you depending on your background: [GitHub student
pack](https://education.github.com/pack)


Recommended Books
-----------------
**There is no required textbook for this course.**

We
do, however, highly
recommend [Python for Data
Science](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook) and its companion
text [A Whirlwind Tour of
Python](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython). Both books are
available free on GitHub in Jupyter Notebook form. For maximum enjoyment,
consider reading the relevant chapters before coming to class.

We will link to
relevant online resources throughout the course.

If you would like additional
material on the basics, the following resources may be useful:

* [Python for
Biologists](http://pythonforbiologists.com/) by Martin Jones; an archived PDF
may be found in this repo in the extras folder under the name p4b.pdf.
* [Learn
python the hard way (ebook freely available from the
author)](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) by Zed A. Shaw; a video course
is also [available](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/).
* [Think python (ebook
freely available from the
author)](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.html) by Allen B.
Downey.
* [Python for Everybody: Exploring Data In Python 3 (ebook freely
available from the author)](https://www.pythonlearn.com/book.php) by Charles
Severance
* [Python
Cookbook](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000393/index.html) by
David Beazy
For more information about python, please see the official Python
Software Foundation website at https://www.python.org/

Assignments and Grading
-----------------------

The emphasis of the course is on learning and mastering
the skills covered. It is my hope that everyone will be able to complete the
assignments and project. If some of the material appears unclear please ask for
clarification.

Assignments will be uploaded to the website.

Grading
__assignments__ will follow the following rubric:

* Program runs, produces
correct result, contains useful comments, meaningful variable names, follows
coding conventions: A+
* Program runs, produces correct result, contains useful
comments: A
* Program runs, produces something close to the correct result: B
*
Program runs, does not produce correct result: C
* Program does not run:
Incomplete (I)

Grading the __final project__ will follow the
following rubric:
