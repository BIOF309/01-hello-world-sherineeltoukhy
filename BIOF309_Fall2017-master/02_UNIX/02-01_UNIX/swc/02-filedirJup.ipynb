    "## Navigating Files and Directories\n",
    "Teaching: 15 minute\n",
    "Exercises: 0 minute\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions:\n",
    "- \"How can I move around on my computer?\"\n",
    "- \"How can I see what files and directories I have?\"\n",
    "- \"How can I specify the location of a file or directory on my computer?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Objectives:\n",
    "- \"Explain the similarities and differences between a file and a directory.\"\n",
    "- \"Translate an absolute path into a relative path and vice versa.\"\n",
    "- \"Construct absolute and relative paths that identify specific files and directories.\"\n",
    "- \"Explain the steps in the shell's read-run-print cycle.\"\n",
    "- \"Identify the actual command, flags, and filenames in a command-line call.\"\n",
    "- \"Demonstrate the use of tab completion, and explain its advantages.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points:\n",
    "- \"The file system is responsible for managing information on the disk.\"\n",
    "- \"Information is stored in files, which are stored in directories (folders).\"\n",
    "- \"Directories can also store other directories, which forms a directory tree.\"\n",
    "- \"`cd path` changes the current working directory.\"\n",
    "- \"`ls path` prints a listing of a specific file or directory; `ls` on its own lists the current working directory.\"\n",
    "- \"`pwd` prints the user's current working directory.\"\n",
    "- \"`whoami` shows the user's current identity.\"\n",
    "- \"`/` on its own is the root directory of the whole file system.\"\n",
    "- \"A relative path specifies a location starting from the current location.\"\n",
    "- \"An absolute path specifies a location from the root of the file system.\"\n",
    "- \"Directory names in a path are separated with '/' on Unix, but '\\\\\\\\' on Windows.\"\n",
    "- \"'..' means 'the directory above the current one'; '.' on its own means 'the current directory'.\"\n",
    "- \"Most files' names are `something.extension`. The extension isn't required, and doesn't guarantee anything, but is normally used to indicate the type of data in the file.\"\n",
    "- \"Most commands take options (flags) which begin with a '-'.\"\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The part of the operating system responsible for managing files and directories\n",
    "is called the **file system**.\n",
    "It organizes our data into files,\n",
    "which hold information,\n",
    "and directories (also called \"folders\"),\n",
    "which hold files or other directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several commands are frequently used to create, inspect, rename, and delete files and directories.\n",
    "Now we will start exploring them, using Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text.\" The main advantage of Jupyter Notebook is interactivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using UNIX-style shell commands in Jupyter QtConsole and Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "You should use all of the commands in this lesson without any modification except whoami. For whoami, add an exclamation point (!) in front of this command i.e. !whoami. We will go over the difference between including and not including the exclamation point (!) later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dollar sign is a **prompt**, which shows us that the shell is waiting for input;\n",
    "your shell may use a different character as a prompt and may add information before\n",
    "the prompt. When typing commands, either from these lessons or from other sources,\n",
    "do not type the prompt, only the commands that follow it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type the command `whoami`,\n",
    "then press the Enter key (sometimes marked Return) to send the command to the shell.\n",
    "The command's output is the ID of the current user,\n",
    "i.e.,\n",
    "it shows us who the shell thinks we are:"

    "> ## Username Variation\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In this lesson, we have used the username `nelle` (associated\n",
    "> with our hypothetical scientist Nelle) in example input and output throughout.  \n",
    "> However, when\n",
    "> you type this lesson's commands on your computer,\n",
    "> you should see and use something different,\n",
    "> namely, the username associated with the user account on your computer.  This\n",

    "> ## Home Directory Variation\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The home directory path will look different on different operating systems.\n",
    "> On Linux it may look like `/home/nelle`,\n",
    "> and on Windows it will be similar to `C:\\Documents and Settings\\nelle` or\n",
    "> `C:\\Users\\nelle`.  \n",
    "> (Note that it may look slightly different for different versions of Windows.)\n",
    "> In future examples, we've used Mac output as the default - Linux and Windows\n",
    "> output may differ slightly, but should be generally similar.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand what a \"home directory\" is,\n",
    "let's have a look at how the file system as a whole is organized.  For the\n",
    "sake of example, we'll be\n",
    "illustrating the filesystem on our scientist Nelle's computer.  After this\n",
    "illustration, you'll be learning commands to explore your own filesystem,\n",
    "which will be constructed in a similar way, but not be exactly identical.  \n",
    "\n",
    "On Nelle's computer, the filesystem looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![The File System](../fig/filesystem.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "At the top is the **root directory**\n",
    "that holds everything else.\n",
    "We refer to it using a slash character `/` on its own;\n",
    "this is the leading slash in `/Users/nelle`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside that directory are several other directories:\n",
    "`bin` (which is where some built-in programs are stored),\n",
    "`data` (for miscellaneous data files),\n",
    "`Users` (where users' personal directories are located),\n",
    "`tmp` (for temporary files that don't need to be stored long-term),\n",
    "and so on.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We know that our current working directory `/Users/nelle` is stored inside `/Users`\n",
    "because `/Users` is the first part of its name.\n",
    "Similarly,\n",
    "we know that `/Users` is stored inside the root directory `/`\n",
    "because its name begins with `/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ## Slashes\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Notice that there are two meanings for the `/` character.\n",
    "> When it appears at the front of a file or directory name,\n",
    "> it refers to the root directory. When it appears *inside* a name,\n",
    "> it's just a separator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Underneath `/Users`,\n",
    "we find one directory for each user with an account on Nelle's machine,\n",
    "her colleagues the Mummy and Wolfman.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![Home Directories](../fig/home-directories.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Mummy's files are stored in `/Users/imhotep`,\n",
    "Wolfman's in `/Users/larry`,\n",
    "and Nelle's in `/Users/nelle`.  Because Nelle is the user in our\n",
    "examples here, this is why we get `/Users/nelle` as our home directory.  \n",
    "Typically, when you open a new command prompt you will be in\n",
    "your home directory to start.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's learn the command that will let us see the contents of our\n",
    "own filesystem.  We can see what's in our home directory by running `ls`,\n",
    "which stands for \"listing\":\n",
    "\n",
    "(Again, your results may be slightly different depending on your operating\n",
    "system and how you have customized your filesystem.)\n",
    "\n",
    "`ls` prints the names of the files and directories in the current directory in\n",
    "alphabetical order,\n",
    "arranged neatly into columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many bash commands, and programs that people have written that can be\n",
    "run from within bash, support a `--help` flag to display more\n",
    "information on how to use the commands or programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on how to use `ls` we can type `man ls`.\n",
    "`man` is the Unix \"manual\" command:\n",
    "it prints a description of a command and its options,\n",
    "and (if you're lucky) provides a few examples of how to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ## `man` and Git for Windows\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The bash shell provided by Git for Windows does not\n",
    "> support the `man` command. Doing a web search for\n",
    "> `unix man page COMMAND` (e.g. `unix man page grep`)\n",
    "> provides links to numerous copies of the Unix manual\n",
    "> pages online.\n",
    "> For example, GNU provides links to its\n",
    "> [manuals](http://www.gnu.org/manual/manual.html):\n",
