    "What if we were to change this file?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Changes made by hand (in GUI applications) are incredibly hard to track. Some tools are better than others, but this is outside our control.\n",
    "- If we changed our only copy of the raw data, we may never be able to reproduce what we did.\n",
    "- We want to track **exactly** what changed in the file, and if we must do it by hand, we should make that easy to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some ideas to detect changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Include the date stamp in the file name\n",
    "    - `2017-03-15_01_dleehr-fixes_gapminderDataFiveYear_superDirty.xlsx`\n",

    "\n",
    "Clearly label the file or make the location for the file that makes sense to future you and collaborators.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to structure your project folders\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important way to delineate file types and organize the workflow of your project is to design your file structure at the very start of your project's history.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often you do not know exactly where your project will lead, so it is okay if your intitial design evolves as the project does. There are a few standards that we will walk through that work well for most projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a folder that will house all of your projects and call it `projects`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "projects/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's make a folder within that folder for our new project, called `gapminder`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "projects/\n",
    "    gapminder/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have data, we want to create a `data` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "projects/\n",
    "    gapminder/\n",
    "        data/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have this Excel spreadsheet as our original, raw data, we will save it in a folder called `00_raw` to indicate that it is the starting point for our project. Create a subfolder in `data/` called `00_raw` and put the `gapminderDataFiveYear_superDirty.xlsx` file there. Now you should have a folder structure that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "projects/\n",
    "    gapminder/\n",
    "        data/\n",
    "            00_raw/\n",
    "                gapminderDataFiveYear_superDirty.xlsx\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we want to change something in this file, we will create a *new* folder in `data/` that shows that it is different from `00_raw/`, and we will call it `01_cleaning/`. Make a subfolder in `data/` called `01_cleaning/` and put a copy of the `gapminderDataFiveYear_superDirty.xlsx` file there. Then, make an *empty* subfolder called `02_cleaned` in the `data/` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "projects/\n",
    "    gapminder/\n",
    "        data/\n",
    "            00_raw/\n",
    "                gapminderDataFiveYear_superDirty.xlsx\n",
    "            01_cleaning/\n",
    "                gapminderDataFiveYear_superDirty.xlsx\n",
    "            02_cleaned/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With this structure, we can capture and communicate most of the characteristics of data as it exsts in our project: history, function, and format. In addition, there is a clear understanding of how to proceed to the next step, data cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why `01_cleaning` and `02_cleaned`?\n",
    "\n",
    "Realistically, we may not completely **clean** a file in one pass. Sometimes we'll get interrupted, and sometimes we'll catch things later and need to revise the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Copy the original raw data into `01_cleaning` (e.g. the xlsx file)\n",
    "2. Edit the file in `01_cleaning`, saving there and recording changes.\n",
    "3. Export a cleaned version in CSV or Tab-delimited format to `02_cleaned`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we catch things later, we\n",
    "don't put a file in `02_cleaned` until we're done with it. And if we have more cleaning to do, we start from `01_cleaning` and produce a new file in `02_cleaned`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ## Tips and Tricks\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - Make your raw data read-only, so you cannot inadvertently change the file.\n",
    "> - Put gnarly incoming data in **quarantine**, then convert, rename, and document.\n",
    "> - Use ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD) dates at the beginning of data file names to make them sortable\n",
    "\n",
    "## Record keeping\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other characteristics of the data that don't fit into file and directory names, such as the origin of the data. A common solution to keeping this detailed information in the project is adding metadata files. We will cover practices for metadata in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ## Good, Better, Best\n",
    "> * **Good** Separate input, code, and from output using different folders or file names and keep track of all the input->output changes in separate files. Use descriptive file/directory names that convey function and history\n",
    "> * **Better** Consistent folder structure across projects, ISO 8601 date stamps in file and directory names, read-only raw data\n",
    "> * **Best** Script to generate folder structures, Version control to track modifications"

    "## Why READMEs\n",
    "\n",
    "Every project should describe to users what the purpose of the project is. This is commonly done in a README file. As the starting point for a project the README file is formatted as plain text (or [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)) to make it easily readable. A README file should include the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The project name\n",

    "\n",
    "Think about the beginning of this lesson, when we had nothing but a file with a name. These are the things that would have made it easy to make sense of that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, before we make any modifications to the raw data, we need a practice for how to record the initial state of the data, as well as our modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding a Top Level README\n",
    "\n",
    "To add a README to our project, open a text editor. For Mac users this can be [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html), [NotePad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) for Windows users.\n",

    "* Save as `README` in the project directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "This file serves as the starting point for future you, or anyone who receives this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding a README in a Subdirectory\n",
    "\n",
    "README files in subdirectories are a good idea too. Often there are many files, and it's distracting to fill the top-level README with details about smaller pieces of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For raw data directories, you should include the location (e.g URL) where the file was retrieved or generated.\n",
    "- For modified data directories, you should include the exact tools and steps used to modify the data, along with dates\n",
    "- For other directories like code or documentation, the README should communicate what the directories contain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Keeping the READMEs up-to-date\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dates are good on file names here\n",
    "- When changing something in a directory, you should add a line at the README\n",
    "\n",
    "## Self-documenting Projects\n",
    "\n",
    "READMEs are commentary on what we consider the \"real work\", and realistically can be an afterthought. We've all had projects under a deadline or someone asking for a result, and the documentation step is easy to defer until later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later never comes, or we forget the details by the time it does. So another good practice is to use good, descriptive names on files, directories, and in code. These are for our benefit, not the computer.\n",

    "## Recording our actions\n",

It's true - recording each modification by hand is time-consuming. It's also easy to forget steps, mis-represent what you've done, and generally poorly convey the true state of the data. For this reason, it's much preferred to use a *script* to automate the cleaning of your data. We'll cover this in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another challenge with using GUIs is that they tend to have different ways of doing the same thing. For example, bring up the `Save As` menu in the editor that you're using. You might notice that there are many options for saving this data on top of simply specifying a file name and location. In addition, some GUIs have different labels for each row / column. Excel begins its rows at `1`, while python begins its rows with `0`. It is important to record all information about the program used to modify the data, as well as any considerations that should be taken when interpreting the cleaned data.\n",
