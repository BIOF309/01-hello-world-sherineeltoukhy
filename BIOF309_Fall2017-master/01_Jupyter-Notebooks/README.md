survey](https://goo.gl/forms/hKJGAyI0JfjKLgq73)
* Course overview
* An
introduction to programming
* Why Python?
* What can you do with Python?
*

## Why Python
- Python is a widely-used,
general-purpose language.
- Python is easy to write/read/run etc.
- Python has
an awesome community and is under constant development.
- Python has a great
library ecosystem with relatively little redundancy.
- Python was voted the top
language of 2017 by [IEEE
Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/the-2017-top-programming-
languages).
- Python is popular in data science and machine learning. In fact,
Python is more popular than the R programming language, according to
[KDnuggets](http://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/08/python-overtakes-r-leader-
analytics-data-science.html) and
[DataScienceCentral](http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/python-
overtakes-r-for-data-science-and-machine-learning).

## Ben's "What I wish I knew years ago"

Computer time is cheap, humans are expensive, their time is
valuable. Given a task, they need to learn to minimize the time spent writing
the code. Or given a stretch of time, they need to know how to maximize output.
So they need to learn a few best practices to get the most out of their time
(these are just some things I’ve learned that I wish someone told me early on):
* Modularize code, good coding frame work has functions which are agnostic to
input
* Write pseudo-code
* Don’t get too cute with it, just solve the problem
*
Use a style guide. Even if it’s your own made up style guide, just be
consistent. Keep a format that makes bugs easy to spot.
* Minimize time spent
debugging. That means writing code in chunks, where you get total confidence in
one chunk before moving on to the next.
* Comment your code; make comments
follow some consistent formatting.
* Error rate is ~proportional to the number
of lines of code you write. Concise code with helpful comments minimizes error
rate.
* Log your bugs, and don’t repeat them. Every time you spend time
debugging, write down the issue once you solve it, and make a checklist for
yourself like a pilot before takeoff. If something doesn’t work next time, you
have a list of most probable candidates to check first.
* People type at about
the same rate, codes usually run at about the same speed, people often get the
right idea at about the same speed. These things often vary on a time scales of
mere minutes. Yet, people vary in how fast they implement successful code on a
time scales of hours, days, or even weeks. This is because debugging is your
rate limiting factor. Get good at debugging, minimize time spent doing I. Solve
your problem today, not two weeks from now.
* You’re going to have problems that
you try and try to solve for days and make no progress, and then something will
budge. Given a stretch of time to work on something, this means your progress is
binary: you made headway, or you didn’t. These best practices are a starting
point for you, but you (the student) need to figure out for yourself how
maximize the frequency of making things budge.

## Homework

Find a cool Jupyter notebook to
share with the class! Use the resources notebook (01-01-14_Resources.ipynb),
[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/), Google, or any other means to find a
notebook that interests you. You will have 60 seconds to discuss the notebook
and tell everyone why you find it interesting. You can run the notebook in
presentation mode or just scroll, but do **NOT** use powerpoint. Please add a
link to the notebook you selected to the [cool-
notebooks](https://biof309.slack.com/messages/C6WUUDV0D/) channel on our [class
Slack team](https://biof309.slack.com).

## Next week

Next week, we will
present our chosen notebooks, learn to use UNIX commands, and talk about
strings. We will then build on our UNIX skills in week 3, when we cover git.
Also in week 3, we will create [GitHub](https://github.com) repositories for the
homework assignments and final projects.
