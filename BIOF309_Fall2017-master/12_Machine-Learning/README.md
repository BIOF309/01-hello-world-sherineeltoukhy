## Activity

* [DataCamp - Titanic 1](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/kaggle-python-tutorial-on-machine-learning/getting-started-with-python)

## Homework

Your homework is to prepare an example of how you might use Machine Learning and push the example to GitHub.

Also, please [install BioPython](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html#htoc4) so that you can have it ready for next class.
