    "## Navigating Files and Directories\n",
    "Teaching: 15 minute\n",
    "Exercises: 0 minute\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions:\n",
    "- \"How can I move around on my computer?\"\n",
    "- \"How can I see what files and directories I have?\"\n",
    "- \"How can I specify the location of a file or directory on my computer?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Objectives:\n",
    "- \"Explain the similarities and differences between a file and a directory.\"\n",
    "- \"Translate an absolute path into a relative path and vice versa.\"\n",
    "- \"Construct absolute and relative paths that identify specific files and directories.\"\n",
    "- \"Explain the steps in the shell's read-run-print cycle.\"\n",
    "- \"Identify the actual command, flags, and filenames in a command-line call.\"\n",
    "- \"Demonstrate the use of tab completion, and explain its advantages.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points:\n",
    "- \"The file system is responsible for managing information on the disk.\"\n",
    "- \"Information is stored in files, which are stored in directories (folders).\"\n",
    "- \"Directories can also store other directories, which forms a directory tree.\"\n",
    "- \"`cd path` changes the current working directory.\"\n",
    "- \"`ls path` prints a listing of a specific file or directory; `ls` on its own lists the current working directory.\"\n",
    "- \"`pwd` prints the user's current working directory.\"\n",
    "- \"`/` on its own is the root directory of the whole file system.\"\n",
    "- \"A relative path specifies a location starting from the current location.\"\n",
    "- \"An absolute path specifies a location from the root of the file system.\"\n",
    "- \"Directory names in a path are separated with '/' on Unix, but '\\\\\\\\' on Windows.\"\n",
    "- \"'..' means 'the directory above the current one'; '.' on its own means 'the current directory'.\"\n",
    "- \"Most files' names are `something.extension`. The extension isn't required, and doesn't guarantee anything, but is normally used to indicate the type of data in the file.\"\n",
    "- \"Most commands take options (flags) which begin with a '-'.\"\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The part of the operating system responsible for managing files and directories\n",
    "is called the **file system**.\n",
    "It organizes our data into files,\n",
    "which hold information,\n",
    "and directories (also called \"folders\"),\n",
    "which hold files or other directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several commands are frequently used to create, inspect, rename, and delete files and directories.\n",
    "Now we will start exploring them, using Jupyter Notebook.\n",
